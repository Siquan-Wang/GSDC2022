# Google Smartphone Decimeter Challenge 2022

The goal of this competition is to compute smartphones location down to the decimeter or even centimeter resolution which could enable services that require lane-level accuracy such as HOV lane ETA estimation. My purpose is to develop a machine learning model based on raw location measurements from Android smartphones collected in opensky and light urban roads using datasets collected and seek advanced research in smartphone GNSS positioning accuracy and help people better navigate the world around them.

## Description

•	Estimated raw smartphone locations with decimeter resolution by Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data to improve the current meter level positioning accuracy and build novel navigation methods
•	Performed accelerated robust weighted least squares (WLS) estimation with Jacobian matrix calculation and integrated the WLS position and velocity estimations Kalman Smoother after outlier detection and carrier smoothing 
•	Achieved average 95% percentile error across all phones as small as 1.77 and ranked 17th among 571 teams on Kaggle
